# Session Log — Gupshup Debug
Timestamp: 2026-02-06 15:30:53 -0300

- Ran Gupshup demo send script: response 201 with payload {"status":"error","response":"Gupshup send failed"}.
- Backend logs showed upstream 401 from Gupshup on POST https://api.gupshup.io/sm/api/v1/msg (before client change).
- Updated Gupshup client to align with provided curl example:
  - Endpoint changed to /wa/api/v1/msg
  - Payload switched to form-encoded fields: channel, source, destination, message (JSON), src.name
- Re-ran demo send script: still returns 201 with {"status":"error","response":"Gupshup send failed"}.
- Requested latest backend logs after the change to confirm new upstream status.
