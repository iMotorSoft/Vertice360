Session snapshot - 2026-01-11 23:38:29 -0300

Context
- Added smoke tests for Vertice360 Workflow demo covering engine, REST, SSE contract, and webhook best-effort.
- Implemented a safe env-var hook to disable outbound Meta WhatsApp sends during tests.
- Added a single runner script to execute backend tests and frontend sanity in one command.

Key files touched/added
- backend/tests/conftest.py
- backend/tests/test_vertice360_workflow_smoke.py
- backend/modules/messaging/providers/meta/whatsapp/client.py
- scripts/run_demo_smoke.sh

Notes
- SSE events are captured by monkeypatching the global broadcaster publisher in tests.
- Outbound Meta send is bypassed only when DEMO_DISABLE_META_SEND=1.
- Runner falls back to checking the demo page file if pnpm is unavailable.

Next steps ideas
- Run `bash scripts/run_demo_smoke.sh` locally.
- Review webhook debug logs if signature validation is enabled.
