Session snapshot - 2026-01-18 22:37:43 -0300

Context
- Added a deterministic LangGraph-based AI workflow demo with step tracking, SSE events, and in-memory run store.
- Expanded intent classification to multi-intent scoring, added pragmatics node, and enriched SSE step payloads.
- Implemented mode validation (heuristic/llm) with provider guardrails and updated tests.
- Created a new Astro/Svelte 5 “AI Workflow Studio” demo page with responsive layout, SSE stream, and run inspector.
- Fixed Svelte 5 runes usage to avoid functions rendering in UI and added view-model fields in state.

Notes
- SSE emits ai_workflow.* events through the global stream and includes summary + compact data.
- UI enforces min-w-0 and overflow-safe containers for responsive behavior.

Next steps ideas
- Smoke test: run the new demo page and verify SSE updates + run inspector fields.
- Optional: add a small UI test for multi-intent + pragmatics fields.
